       " '\\n\\nI am writing to bring your attention to a road safety risk that is initiated by Stage Coach Aberdeen on the X17 & X18 routes. The X17 & X18 buses park up and wait to align times to the time table on B9119 Skene Rd. This practise occurs on numerous times per day and at times both side of this busy main road are blocked as X17 & X18 busses traveling in both direction are stopped waiting while their time aligns with the timetable. While these busses are waiting in this location as there is not a recess / pull in for the busses at this location the roads main traffic flow in both directions has to overtake the parked buses, which is a road safety issue. It should also be noted that there is also a pedestrian crossing at this location and as vehicles pull out to pass the parked buses the pedestrian crossing could be compromised due to a vehicles vision being obstructed by the parked buses. It is advised that Stage Coach review this park and wait practise of the X17 & X18 bus to align buses to timetable timing and ensure that the locations selected to carry out this activity do not add any road safety risk to other road users. Ideally such waiting location should be selected where the bus stop has a pull in or as a minimum the location is not opposite another waiting area on the other side of the road, to have both sides of a road blocked by waiting busses shows a lack of focus of the Stage Coach towards road safety. Other bus routes should also be reviewed and amended to prevent similar issues.\\n',\n",
